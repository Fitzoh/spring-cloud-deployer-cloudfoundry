This project provides a common means to deploy applications to Cloud Foundry based on the Spring Cloud Deployer SPI.

== Building

Clone the repo and type

----
$ ./mvnw clean install

The project includes a set of integration tests that can be run against a Cloud Foundry installation, provided that
connection information is correctly set. If credentials are not set correctly, those tests will be silently skipped.
Below is the list of environment variables you'll want to specify:

----
# url of the CF API (used when using cf login -a for example)
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_API_ENDPOINT

# name of the space into which modules will be deployed
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_SPACE

# name of the organization that owns the space above
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_ORGANIZATION

# the root domain to use when mapping routes
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_DOMAIN

# Comma separated set of service instance names to bind to the deployed app
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_SERVICES

# username and password of the user to use to create apps
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_USERNAME
SPRING_CLOUD_CLOUDFOUNDRY_DEPLOYER_PASSWORD

# whether to allow self-signed certificates during SSL validation
